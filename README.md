# yoga_page
This page showcases a Yoga Experience Platform, featuring two sections. The first section introduces the platform with a headline, image, brief description, and a "Get Started" button. The second section provides details on different types of yoga, like Acro yoga, Vinyasa, Hatha, and Kundalini, each accompanied by images and descriptions, with a "Back" button to return to the previous section. It uses Bootstrap for responsive design and structured layout.
